I'm a PhD student at the Technion's Faculty of Medicine, supervised by Dr. Naama Geva-Zatrosky (Technion) and Dr. Itai Sharon (MIGAL - Galilee Research Institute). I am studying the functional plasticity of the gut microbiota - specifically the mechanisms by which bacteria alter their immunomodulatory effects on the mammalian host.
